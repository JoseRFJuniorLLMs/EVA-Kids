SDK setup and configuration

npm

CDN

Config
If you're already using npm and a module bundler such as webpack or Rollup, you can run the following command to install the latest SDK (Learn more):

npm install firebase
Then, initialize Firebase and begin using the SDKs for the products you'd like to use.

// Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAnalytics } from "firebase/analytics";
// TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
// https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries

// Your web app's Firebase configuration
// For Firebase JS SDK v7.20.0 and later, measurementId is optional
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyBi4rXT6aH8G_J-7FMsns55IODN1taAQSg",
  authDomain: "priming-ia-edu.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "priming-ia-edu",
  storageBucket: "priming-ia-edu.firebasestorage.app",
  messagingSenderId: "835801229958",
  appId: "1:835801229958:web:07cb2e1e356de834b0bf07",
  measurementId: "G-F919L4ZWV3"
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const analytics = getAnalytics(app);
Note: This option uses the modular JavaScript SDK, which provides reduced SDK size.
